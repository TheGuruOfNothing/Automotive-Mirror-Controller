# Automotive-Mirror-Controller
A DIY mirror controller I created for a 1992 Ford Pickup that I installed 2016 Tahoe mirrors on. I started pricing the parts to wire up these fancy ass towing mirrors and it RAPIDLY got out of control. I was already almost $300 US for the mirrors (but they are REALLY nice mirrors!) and I couldn't stomach tacking another couple hundred on to that to make them work. I wanted everything relay controlled to prevent contact burning on the switch so creating my own "brain" was the answer.

I also created a YouTube video on this setup in case you are interested...
